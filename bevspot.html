                <h5>Help Center</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>One of my most high-value projects while at BevSpot was designing and developing a public help center. Before the Help Center, every new user was personally onboarded over the phone with a Customer Success representative. As BevSpot continued growing its userbase, it was crucial that a knowledge base full of tips and documentation existed for users who self-onboarded or needed assistance outside normal business hours. This would not only be beneficial to users, but hopefully increase BevSpot customer retention and organic customer growth.</p>
                    <!-- <p>I worked closely with Customer Success team members to gain insights on the established onboarding process and find out what common stumbling blocks existed. The Help Center articles would be written and maintained by Customer Success team members, so determining the format(s), grouping, and hierarchy of information was a collaborative process.</p>
                    <p>I chose to organize Help Center content around the six core sections of the BevSpot web app. Each of these sections would have their own Help Center page complete with a detailed overview of the section, featured articles (selected by Customer Success), and a list of articles organized by subcategory. Search was also implemented, allowing specific articles to be found with minimum friction.</p>
                    <p>Once high-fidelity mockups were finalized, I began development. The Help Center was developed as its own custom WordPress theme within the BevSpot public site. Fully responsive page templates were developed for the Help Center homepage, category pages, overview pages, and basic articles. Each was designed and developed for dynamic content with considerations for breadcrumb navigation, videos, section breaks, various header styles,  author information, and related links. This system design approach ensured that the Help Center could evolve and adapt over time with minimal upkeep.</p> -->

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>With a direction in mind, I began researching precedents. I purchased over a dozen leading (design-forward) independent magazines, analyzing content, stylistic choices, and medium-specific nuances perhaps otherwise taken for granted. I then did the same with online longform publishers and immersive web&nbsp;experiences.</p>
                    <p>I found that many “digital magazines” are in fact either content-rich blogs or lifeless PDF scans of  print publications. If Compile was to be successful, it would need to convey the confidence, creativity, and quality of print magazines while embracing its digital medium by leveraging the immersiveness and interactivity of modern web&nbsp;design.</p>

                <h5>Content</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>Content collection was an ongoing effort throughout the project lifecycle. I decided early on that curating magazine content using pre-existing media would be the most feasible and enjoyable way to source content.</p>
                    <p>The theme for Compile 001 would be Time. I kept a spreadsheet of potential content sources which acted as an editable overview for the magazine, allowing me to easily rearrange content and assure I included a variety of media types. My goal was to amass enough interesting content to engage users for at least 30 minutes from start to&nbsp;finish.</p>

                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>I drew out the general information architecture for Compile leaning heavily on the familiar experience of flipping through a print magazine. I decided that curation would be most effective if content had an intentional progression, but also wanted to give users the option to casually hop from article to&nbsp;article.</p>
                    <p>I then drew rough wireframes considering the user flow throughout each issue. Each sketch was made into both graybox and high-fidelity wireframes using&nbsp;Sketch.</p>

                <h5>Visual design</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>One of the core motivations for Compile was to break out of the standardized layout shared by most blogs, instead giving each article a unique design treatment that could amplify or recontextualize the themes and tones within. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/majical-cloudz/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> succeed in this with many of their longform editorials and interactive&nbsp;features.</p>
                    <p>To emphasize the uniqueness of each piece of content, I designed each "article" using a unique layout, font pairing, palette, and graphic style. With the exception of found photography, all graphic elements and compositions are my own. I encourage you to see them in&nbsp;context.</p>

                    <p>Every issue of Compile is presented as a single long-scrolling experience where each article blends into the next. The table of contents acts as a potential jumping off point for users looking for a specific piece of content. A fixed timeline on the left edge of the browser window acts as condensed table of contents, encouraging&nbsp;exploration.</p>
                    <p>The icons used throughout Compile are intentionally simplistic, letting the content take center stage. The top-left Compile icon links to the site's landing page while the top-right icon scrolls the page back to the start of the&nbsp;issue.</p>

                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>I knew from the outset that I wanted Compile to be weird, expressive, and (if possible) darkly humorous. In short, I wanted to make something that I would give my attention to if I stumbled across it online.</p>
                    <p>I saved the Compile identity for the tail end of my design process so that content collection and article design could be guided by a brand but uninhibited by a visual identity. This allowed me to create the bulk of the first issue, then use it as inspiration for an authentic wordmark and identity.</p>
                    <p>I ultimately made the Compile wordmark by manipulating type using a scanner. I felt that this conveyed the subversive nature of the brand and embodied of the relationship between humans and technology that the publication focuses on.
