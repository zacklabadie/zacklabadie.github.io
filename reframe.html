                    <p>Exactly what the service would be and who it would help were left entirely open. Seeing this as an opportunity to leverage design for social good, Christine and I chose children in the foster care system as our target demographic. With that decided, our next step was to define autonomy as it applies to children.</p>

                    <p>We started defining autonomy by brainstorming actions, items, and feelings we associated with freedom of choice. We then began grouping these words, ultimately creating a systems diagram that illustrates the relationships and feedback loops between the various components of autonomous living. Color was used to introduce hierarchy, with gold nodes representing goal states and dark blue nodes identifying key requisites.</p>

                    <p>We then created a stakeholder map illustrating key figures in the life of a child in or at risk of entering foster care.

This mapping was derived from initial research and led to a focus on the relationship between foster child and social worker.</p>

                    <p>For a number of obvious reasons, we chose not to pursue interviews with children currently undergoing foster home placement. Instead, we sought out stories from past foster youth such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/01/11/508608745/after-20-years-young-man-leaves-foster-care-on-his-own-terms" target="_blank">Noel Anaya</a>.</p>
                    <p>We did, however, conduct interviews with a variety of professionals and foster parents including <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/commstudies/people/elise-dallimore/" target="_blank">Emily Mann</a>, an accomplished Senior Research Associate with a Ph.D. in Social Welfare, and <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2015/08/fixing-massachusetts-troubled-foster-care-system/" target="_blank">Elise Dallimore</a>, an Associate Professor specializing in organizational development.</p>

                    <p>These personal accounts and expert perspectives were hugely influential in our understanding of the foster care system, the struggles of those within it, and the gravity of the situation as a whole. Perhaps the most crucial insight was that a positive feedback loop can exist for foster care youth who become traumatized by their time in the system, develop emotional or psychological issues, have trouble finding permanent placement due to that fact, then have their temperment erode further as a result of repeated relocation.</p>
                    <p>Every interview subject agreed: <b>stability is essential</b> for a child to have a fair shot at success.</p>

                    <p>As our understanding of the foster care experience solidified, we combined qualitative and quantitative research findings into a user journey. The diagram includes important touchpoints and stakeholders throughout a child's foster care experience, charting the emotional impacts of each. Diverging paths at the moment of relocation are accompanied by their statistical likelihood, illustrating in broad strokes some of the starkly different outcomes possible.</p>
                    <p>This chart is no doubt overly clinical given the emotional turmoil and profound nuances present in almost all foster care cases. However, it clearly shows the value of minimizing relocations while working towards reunification or long-term adoption. It also highlights the huge statistical disadvantage faced by foster youth who age out of the system.</p>

                    <p>Our research, interviews, and user journey made it clear that true <b>autonomy</b> was the result of <b>stability</b>. Minor stability could come in the form of social support or daily personal routines. Major stability, of course, would come in the form of reunification or a happy adoption. Christine and I set out to conceptualize a service that could offer both minor stability and a path towards major stability.</p>
                    <p>We began by brainstorming any and all services imaginable. Next, we plotted these services on a grid of cost vs. value. Cost is measured by how logistically difficult a service would be to implement. Value is measured by the meaningful impact a service could provide for a child in foster care. An ideal service would reside in the upper-left quadrant, being both low-cost and high-value.</p>

                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>After updating the Lasso prototype to reflect insights from user testing, I began developing a logo and visual identity for the app. Although this project's primary focus was on user experience and interaction design, I believe cohesive visual design is fundamental to both. I began with the logo, sketching dozens of ideas inspired by video iconography, the letter L, and the concept of consolidation. These were narrowed down to two options, each with several color explorations, before the final logo was chosen and polished.</p>
                    <p>I then expanded this branding into a design system that could be applied throughout the application. Since Lasso was designed for televisions, it features large typography that's legible from a distance and a dark background ideal for low-light environments. Primary and secondary brand colors were used sparingly throughout the app, meant to pop against swaths of black. Azo Sans was used in headers to inject a bit of personality, while Aktiv Grotesk was used in forms and body text due to its simplicity and legibility at small sizes.</p>

                    <p>Lasso is far from finished. One area of particular interest is further developing a set of preference tools that could aid in Lasso's machine learning customization while empowering users who prefer fine-tuned control. By aggregating the data of several streaming apps, Lasso could form a more holistic image of the user's preferences and  habits. I believe this is the first step towards a modern, human-centered TV viewing experience. I believe it's also crucial be transparent about these algorithmically-derived insights so that when they're wrong, users are able to correct them without confusion or frustration.</p>
