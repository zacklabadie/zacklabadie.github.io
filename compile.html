                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>Compile, my undergraduate degree project, only started taking shape after a lengthy ideation process. I began by drafting constraints in the form of personal, professional, and academic requirements for the project in&nbsp;question.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these benchmarks, I set two rules for myself. Rule 1: The project must engage with a real problem, putting function before form. Rule 2: Make something I’m proud&nbsp;of.</p>
                    <p>Keeping these things in mind, I opened myself up to inspiration. Ultimately, my interest in storytelling, experience with web development, and admiration for indie magazine design led me to an expressive tech-focused web/magazine hybrid called&nbsp;Compile.</p>
                </div>

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>With a direction in mind, I began researching precedents. I purchased over a dozen leading (design-forward) independent magazines, analyzing content, stylistic choices, and medium-specific nuances perhaps otherwise taken for granted. I then did the same with online longform publishers and immersive web&nbsp;experiences.</p>
                    <p>I found that many “digital magazines” are in fact either content-rich blogs or lifeless PDF scans of  print publications. If Compile was to be successful, it would need to convey the confidence, creativity, and quality of print magazines while embracing its digital medium by leveraging the immersiveness and interactivity of modern web&nbsp;design.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Time constraints kept me from conducting in-depth user research, which would normally be a staple component in my design process. Given the chance to revisit this project, user research would be critical in evolving the Compile user flow and evaluating readers' engagement with&nbsp;content.</p> -->

                <h5>Content</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>Content collection was an ongoing effort throughout the project lifecycle. I decided early on that curating magazine content using pre-existing media would be the most feasible and enjoyable way to source content. Uninterested in regurgitating tech news, I chose to have each issue of Compile revolve arounda central theme instead of being tethered to current&nbsp;events.</p>
                    <p>The theme for Compile 001 would be Time. I kept a spreadsheet of potential content sources which acted as an editable overview for the magazine, allowing me to easily rearrange content and assure I included a variety of media types. My goal was to amass enough interesting content to engage users for at least 30 minutes from start to&nbsp;finish.</p>

                <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>I drew out the general information architecture for Compile leaning heavily on the familiar experience of flipping through a print magazine. I decided that curation would be most effective if content had an intentional progression, but also wanted to give users the option to casually hop from article to&nbsp;article.</p>
                    <p>I then drew rough wireframes considering the user flow throughout each issue. Each sketch was made into both graybox and high-fidelity wireframes using&nbsp;Sketch.</p>

                <div class="work-columns">
                    <p>One of the core motivations for Compile was to break out of the standardized layout shared by most blogs, instead giving each article a unique design treatment that could amplify or recontextualize the themes and tones within. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/majical-cloudz/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> succeed in this with many of their longform editorials and interactive features.</p>
                    <p>To emphasize the uniqueness of each piece of content, I designed each "article" using a unique layout, font pairing, palette, and graphic style. With the exception of found photography, all graphic elements and compositions are my own. I encourage you to see them in context.</p>
